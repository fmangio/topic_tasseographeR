# topic tasseographeR

topic tassepgrapheR is an R-shiny protocol aimed at smoothing the topic labelling and validation task by combining top-down and bottom-up text analysis. In particular, it automatically computes two topic-level scores, the topic *content* and topic *function scores*, which provide a quantitative post hoc summary of the presence of specific linguistic constructs within the topics generated by a topic modelling algorithm based on respectively content and function words comprised by validated dictionaries and lexica. 


It comprises two tools:
-topic *content* tasseographeR 
-topic *function* tasseographeR, which are aimed at computing respectively topic content and function scores useful for interpreting and/or validating topic modelling's outputs, as well as to perform Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis.
